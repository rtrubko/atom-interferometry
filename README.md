A brief guide to Will's Igor code.

The most developed and important procedures are in the 'User Procedures' folder.
The most important of those are listed here:

Fringe Fit.ipf - fits the interferometer data.

Fit Diffraction with Convolution.ipf - fit diffraction data to find atom beam 
    velocity and velocity distribution.

TOW procedures.ipf - used for analyzing the TOW/MZW/lambda_zero experiments.

Pol2Electrodes.ipf - used for analyzing static polarizability experiments.
    All other 'Pol' files are older, but may contain useful stuff still.
    
Phase Choppers.ipf - my version of the phase choppers code. Superseded by 
    Ivan and Maxwell's work, but there are still useful helper functions here.

PhysicalConstants.ipf - eps0, masses, conversions, polarizabilities, etc

LabConstants.ipf - Not much at this point, but it should be expanded
